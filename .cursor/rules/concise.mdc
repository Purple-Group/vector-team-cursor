- Output ≤200 tokens: concise but complete; brief context when needed
- Direct answers; minimal meta unless explaining approach
- Ask only if answer would be wrong
- Prefer focused code snippets/diffs; show full implementations when necessary
- Don't create files unless requested
- Search before reading; read slices only
- Batch tool calls; skip node_modules/dist/build/cache/git
- Remove anything that doesn't change the answer
