# Team Collaboration

> Team dynamics and collaboration patterns for AI pod teams.

## Alignment on Engagement

> **"Key was aligning on how we would engage and share our experiences."**

## Team Agreements

### 1. Communication Protocol

* **Async-first**: Document decisions, share in chat, allow for feedback
* **Sync when stuck**: Huddle immediately if blocked > 15 minutes
* **Daily summary**: End of day, share what was built (screenshots, links, summary)

### 2. Working Rhythm

* **Time-boxed sessions**: 2-hour focused sessions
* **Breaks**: 15-minute break every 2 hours

### 3. Decision Framework

* **Type 1 decisions**: Make immediately, document, share
* **Type 2 decisions**: Create doc, async review, decide
* **Escalation path**: If no consensus in 24h, bring to team lead or architect

### 4. Code Review Process

* **PR review**: Async, use checklist, quick turnaround
* **Approval criteria**: 1 approval minimum, checklist complete

### 5. Knowledge Sharing

* **Weekly demo**: Show what was built (even if WIP)
* **Doc updates**: Every feature updates relevant docs
* **Lessons learned**: Weekly retro (30 minutes)

## Collaboration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Async Context Sharing

When working independently:

1. Create a doc with context (e.g., "FEATURE_X_PLAN.md")
2. Share in chat: "Working on Feature X, plan here: [link]"
3. Update doc as you progress
4. Share results: "Feature X complete: [screenshots] [PR link] [summary]"

**Benefits**:

* Team awareness
* Async review possible
* Documentation artifact

### Pattern 2: Demo-Driven Development

* Build for 4 hours → Demo to team (5 minutes) → Get feedback → Iterate
* Don't wait until "perfect"
* Early feedback prevents big rewrites

**Benefits**:

* Early course correction
* Team alignment
* Visible progress

## The Pod Team Structure

**Size**: 2-3 people  
**Skills**: Full-stack generalists (T-shaped)  
**Tools**: AI (Claude, GitHub Copilot, etc.), existing documentation  
**Empowerment**: Make decisions, implement, review with team

**Roles** (fluid):

* **Driver**: Actively prompting AI, implementing changes
* **Navigator**: Reviewing AI output, suggesting improvements
* **Reviewer**: Validating against patterns, testing

**Rotation**: Roles rotate every 30-60 minutes to maintain focus.

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

**Everyone is responsible for**:

* Code quality (follows patterns)
* Testing (unit + integration + E2E)
* Documentation (updates with every feature)
* Unblocking themselves (use AI, don't wait)

## Communication Best Practices

### Async-First Approach

1. **Document decisions** - Write down rationale
2. **Share in chat** - Post link to decision doc
3. **Allow feedback** - 24-hour window for async review
4. **Move forward** - Don't wait for approval on Type 1 decisions

### Sync When Stuck

1. **Recognize blocker** - If stuck > 15 minutes
2. **Huddle immediately** - 5-minute team discussion
3. **Make decision** - Best call with available info
4. **Document** - Write down decision and rationale
5. **Move forward** - Implement and proceed

### Daily Summary

End of day, share:
- What was built (screenshots, links)
- Summary of changes
- Any blockers or decisions made
- Next steps

## Key Takeaways

1. **Async-first** - Document and share, don't wait for meetings
2. **Sync when stuck** - Huddle immediately if blocked > 15 minutes
3. **Time-boxed sessions** - 2-hour focused sessions with breaks
4. **Role rotation** - Driver/Navigator/Reviewer rotate every 30-60 minutes
5. **Daily summaries** - Share progress at end of day
6. **Weekly demos** - Show work even if WIP
7. **Knowledge sharing** - Document everything, share learnings
