# Accelerated Delivery Framework

> Principles and workflows for 10-17x velocity increase through foundation-first development, pattern adherence, and AI-augmented workflows.

---

## Overview

The Accelerated Delivery Framework enables AI pod teams to achieve dramatic velocity increases through:

1. **Foundation First**: Proper project structure and architectural patterns before code
2. **Mental Models**: Clear building blocks defined before execution
3. **Pattern Adherence**: Every prompt starts with architectural context and planning
4. **Shift-Left Testing**: Testing pyramid defined early, AI-generated tests at all layers
5. **Self-Service Model**: Empowered decision-making and rapid unblocking

---

## Core Modules

### 1. Context-Driven Development
See: `ad-context-driven-development.md`

The Context → Plan → Execute workflow ensures every feature follows established patterns.

### 2. Pattern Selection
See: `ad-pattern-selection.md`

How to choose and document architectural patterns that AI can follow.

### 3. Foundation Setup
See: `ad-foundation-setup.md`

Project structure and documentation setup that enables AI-assisted development.

### 4. Testing Pyramid
See: `ad-testing-pyramid.md`

Testing strategy and AI test generation following the 60/30/10 pyramid.

### 5. Self-Service Decision Making
See: `ad-self-service-decision-making.md`

Decision frameworks and rapid unblocking strategies for pod teams.

### 6. Pitfall Prevention
See: `ad-pitfall-prevention.md`

Common pitfalls detection and prevention strategies.

### 7. Team Collaboration
See: `ad-team-collaboration.md`

Team dynamics and collaboration patterns for AI pod teams.

### 8. Success Metrics
See: `ad-success-metrics.md`

Measuring success and ROI tracking for accelerated delivery.

## Quick Start

1. **Foundation Setup**: Use `ad-foundation-setup` command to create foundation docs
2. **Feature Development**: Use `ad-feature-implementation` command for Context→Plan→Execute workflow
3. **Test Generation**: Use `ad-generate-tests` command following testing pyramid
4. **Pattern Review**: Use `ad-pattern-review` command to validate code

## Key Principles

- **Foundation Over Speed**: 20% time on foundation = 80% velocity later
- **Context Is King**: Every prompt includes architectural context
- **Pattern Adherence**: Code must match DESIGN_PATTERNS.md
- **Testing First-Class**: AI generates code AND tests in same session
- **Documentation-Driven**: Code + Tests + Docs = Done
- **Empowered Decisions**: Type 1 (reversible) vs Type 2 (hard to reverse)
